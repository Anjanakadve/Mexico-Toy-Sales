# Mexico-Toy-Sales
# Project Overview
Sales & inventory data for a fictitious toy store chain in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.
# sql Queries
#### 1.location with the highest concentration of stores.

```sql
select count(store_id) as stores ,store_location  from stores
GROUP BY store_location having  count(store_id)
order by stores
```
| Stores | Store_Location |
| :----- | :------------- |
| 3      | Airport        |
| 6      | Residential    |
| 12     | Commercial     |
| 29     | Downtown       |

* **Downtime**

#### 2.Are stores in the "Downtown" area more profitable than those in the "Airport" or "Residential" or 'Commercial' areas
```sql
  SELECT st.Store_Location, 
    SUM(sa.Units * (p.Product_Price - p.Product_Cost)) AS Total_Profit
FROM Stores st
JOIN Sales sa ON st.Store_ID = sa.Store_ID
JOIN Products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY st.Store_Location
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
```
| Store_Location | Total_Profit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Downtown** | 493064.00 |
| **Commercial** | 206288.00 |
| **Residential** | 100542.00 |
| **Airport** | 84428.00 |

* **Revenue Concentration:** The Downtown sector acts as the primary financial engine, contributing approximately 56% of total profits across the entire store network.
* **Location Efficiency:** While Airport locations contribute the lowest total profit (84,428), they represent the highest profit-to-store ratio, indicating a more optimized and high-margin sales model per site.

#### 3.Product Category with their total units sold and total profit
```sql
SELECT 
    p.Product_Category,
    SUM(sa.Units) AS Total_Units_Sold,
    SUM(sa.Units * (p.Product_Price - p.Product_Cost)) AS Total_Profit
FROM Sales sa
JOIN Products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN Stores st ON sa.Store_ID = st.Store_ID
WHERE st.Store_City = 'Guadalajara' -- You can swap this for 'Monterrey', 'Campeche', etc.
GROUP BY p.Product_Category
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
```

| Product_Category | Total_Units_Sold | Total_Profit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electronics** | 4104 | 31923.00 |
| **Toys** | 6555 | 25,878.00 |
| **Games** | 3165 | 10377.00 |
| **Sports & Outdoors** | 2503 | 7638.00 |
| **Art & Crafts** | 3160 | 7137.00 |

* **High-Margin Leadership:** Electronics is the premier profit driver (31,923), yielding the highest return despite moving lower volumes compared to the Toys category.
* **Volume vs. Value:** While Toys dominate in total units sold (6,555), the lower profit-per-unit suggests a strategy focused on high turnover and foot traffic rather than high individual margins.

#### 4.
```sql
SELECT 
    st.Store_City,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(sa.Date) = MONTH(CURDATE()) THEN sa.Units ELSE 0 END) AS Current_Month_Sales,
     SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(sa.Date) = MONTH(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) THEN sa.Units ELSE 0 END) AS Last_Month_Sales,
   (SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(sa.Date) = MONTH(CURDATE()) THEN sa.Units ELSE 0 END) - 
SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(sa.Date) = MONTH(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) THEN sa.Units ELSE 0 END)) AS Unit_Difference
FROM Sales sa
JOIN Stores st ON sa.Store_ID = st.Store_ID
GROUP BY st.Store_City
ORDER BY Unit_Difference DESC;
```
| Store_City | Current_Month_Sales | Last_Month_Sales | Unit_Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tuxtla Gutierrez** | 923 | 655 | **+268** |

| **Toluca** | 1,508 | 1,500 | **+8** |
| **Chilpancingo** | 555 | 574 | -19 |
| **Hermosillo** | 2,213 | 2,251 | -38 |

| **Villahermosa** | 762 | 819 | -57 |
| **Xalapa** | 1,305 | 1,370 | -65 |
| **Monterrey** | 2,974 | 3,059 | -85 |


* **Momentum Leaders:** Tuxtla Gutierrez and Mexicali are showing the strongest growth velocity, indicating a successful local sales surge or effective stock  in those regions.
* **Regional Contraction:** Larger markets like Monterrey and Xalapa are seeing a slight month-over-month decline, suggesting a cooling of demand or potential inventory gaps in major urban centers.


#### 5."Which product categories are driving the most profit,and how efficient is our pricing strategy for each?"
```sql
SELECT  p.Product_Category,
        ROUND(SUM(IFNULL(p.Product_Price - p.Product_Cost, 0) * s.Units), 2) AS Total_Profit,
    
     ROUND(
        AVG(IFNULL(p.Product_Price - p.Product_Cost, 0) / NULLIF(p.Product_Price, 0)) * 100, 
        2
    ) AS Avg_Margin_Percentage
FROM Products p
JOIN Sales s ON p.Product_ID = s.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Category
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
```

| Product_Category | Total_Profit  | Avg_Margin_Percentage  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electronics** | 322,252.00 | **49.56** |

| **Sports & Outdoors** | 99,140.00 | 21.35 |
| **Art & Crafts** | 74,111.00 | 28.69 |

* **Premium Performance:** Electronics is the most efficient category, commanding a near **50% margin**, making it the primary driver of bottom-line growth despite lower sales volume.
* **Volume vs. Efficiency:** Toys generate significant total profit through sheer volume, yet operate on a **thin 23.7% margin**, indicating a pricing strategy built on competitive, high-turnover sales.
